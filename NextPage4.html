<br><p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">His influential 1976 book Computer Power and Human Reason displays his 
ambivalence towards computer technology and lays out his case: while Artificial Intelligence may be possible, we should never allow computers to make 
important decisions because computers will always lack human qualities such as compassion and wisdom. Weizenbaum makes the crucial distinction between 
deciding and choosing. Deciding is a computational activity, something that can ultimately be programmed. Choice, however, is the product of 
, not calculation. It is the capacity to choose that ultimately makes us human. Comprehensive human judgment is able to include non-mathematical 
factors, such as emotions. Judgment can compare apples and oranges, and can do so without quantifying each fruit type and then reductively quantifying each
to factors necessary for comparison.
